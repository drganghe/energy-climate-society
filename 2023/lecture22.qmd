1.  It's warming
2.  It's us
3.  We're sure
4.  It's bad
5.  We can fix it

## Energy vs power
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Energy is the ability to do work. Energy is power integrated over **time**.
- Basic unit: joule = watt<span>&#183;</span>second
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Power is the **rate** at which work is done, or energy is transmitted.
- Basic unit: watt = jourle/second
:::
:::

We need to know what we are talking about!

## Energy project economics

- NPV, discounting, LCOE, learning rate

- Project economics is useful for basic cost-benefit analysis  
- Getting the price (discounting) right  
- Understanding technology dynamics will help to model future projections  
- Aware of the limitations   


## Thermodynamics

-   Thermodynamic **efficiency**\
-   Comparing different technologies\
-   Thermodynamics provides physic limits

## Brayton cycle vs. Rankine cycle

| Brayton Cycle | Rankine Cycle |
|------|------|
| Jet, Gas turbine     | Steam turbine      |
| Open    |  Open/closed circuits    |
| Working fluid in gaseous phase     |  Working fluid phase change    |

## Energy demand

- Energy demand is shaped by dynamic factors: populations, GDP, technology, regulation, and human behavior   
- Understanding those drivers will help us learn the magnitude and profile of our demand  
- Load forecast integrates all insights to the show   


## Energy efficiency

-   There are barriers for energy efficiency and inforamtion and standards can help address the energy efficiency gap\
-   Human behavior is complicated, and understanding it will help us to design policy\
-   Rebound is real but might be overplayed, rebound could be good if improve welfare\
-   Sustainable consumption and production within the limit


## Energy access and energy justice

-   Electricity/energy access is fundamental to other modern services: education, health, and information\
-   Energy access also has gender equity, health cobenefits, and other implications\
-   Energy justice is important to achieve just transition\
-   An reflection on our approaches to energy justice


## Energy, environment, and human health

-   Environmental and health impacts are the externalities of energy systems\
-   Energy-air-pollution-human health framework of analysis\
-   Energy-water-carbon nexus\
-   System impacts show the constraint in systems modeling


## Energy transition

-   Diverse factors that drive energy transition\
-   Common and differentiated solutions to energy\
-   Leverage the advantages\
-   Addressing uncertainties: geopolitics, wars, pandemic, and more


## Power sector decarbonization

-   Power sector's central role in decarbonization\
-   Capacity expansion model to analyze the optimized investment decisions\
-   Decisions in the real world is much more complicated\
-   Emerging trends in the power sector


## Big data and AI

-   AI and big data has transformed how we live, and how can we save the planet\
-   AI does not automatic add new insights, but it provides powerful tools to analyze increasingly available big data\
-   Learning those new tools and skills becomes necessary to work in the field\
-   The potential of using AI/big data to analyze our understanding of energy supply/demand and human behavior is enomorous. 


## LCA

-   System thinking and LCA thinking\
-   LCA could offer insights\
-   Learning those new tools and skills to do basic LCA\
-   LCA is a system think to address energy and climate challenges.   


## Uncertainies and limitation

-   Know the limitation of models\
-   Use model appropriately\
-   Interpret/communicate the results effectively\
-   Models for social good

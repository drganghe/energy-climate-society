## Load Forecasting and EV Penetration

### Background

Accurate load forecasting is essential for power system planning and operation. In this assignment, you will explore New York City's electricity demand using real-world data from NYISO, analyze forecast errors (accuracy), and examine how electric vehicle (EV) adoption could impact the grid.

### Data Source

- Visit NYISO [Custom Reports](https://www.nyiso.com/custom-reports) page and explore available datasets. 

- We will be focusing on:

  - [Day Head Market Load Forcast](OASIS_Day_Ahead_Market_ISO_Load_Forecast.xlsx) (1-hour interval)
  - [Real Time Dispatch Actual Load](OASIS_Real_Time_Dispatch_Actual_Load.xlsx) (5-min interval)
  
- Preprocessed dataset: I have cleaned and combined the dataset in R. The [Combined Load Forecast Actual Data](Combined_Load_Forecast_Actual_Data.csv) file is available for you to use. If youâ€™re interested, you can access the [R code](hw3.R) to replicate or modify the dataset.

### Tasks and Questions

1. Load curve and load duration curve. (1pt)  

- Using Actual Load, plot the hourly load curve and load duration curve of New York City in 2024
- What do these curves reveal about NYC's electricity demand pattern?

2. Average daily load characteristics. (1pt) 

Analyze and visualize the acutal load profile for: 

  - 366 days average load by hour of day (avearage by "Hour_of_Day")  
  - Weekdays vs. weekends average load by hour of day (avearage by "Hour_of_Day", organize by "Is_Weekday") 
  - Monthly avearge houly load (average by "Month")  
  - Seasonal average houly load (avearge by "Season")  

3. Forecast accuracy. (1pt)

- Identifythe hour(s) and day(s) with the largest forecasting error (Actural Load - forecast) 
- Analyze potential causes for these errors (e.g., extreme weather, holidays, economic actiivities)

4. EV adoption and impact on load curve. (1pt)

- Make reasonable assumptions about EV penetration in New York City, 
- Analyze how EV charging would affect the load curve 
- Consider different charging scenarios (e.g., overnight charging, peak-hour charging)

5. Policy incentives. (1pt)

- Should ConEdison be concerned about increased EV charging deamnds? Why or why not?
- What policies or incentives could be introduced to encourage cost-effective and grid-friendly charging behaviors (e.g., time of use rates, smart charging incentives, vehicle to grid programs)?

## An analytical approach

Data-driven, evidence-based, energy and climate policy

Using analytic approach to answer questions such as:

-   What will be the climate future if we do nothing?
-   What technology to invest to achieve our climate goal?
-   What will be the impact to climate under Trump 2.0?
-   How NYS/NYC could achieve its climate goals?

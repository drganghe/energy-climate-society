## Energy vs power
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Energy is the ability to do work. Energy is power integrated over **time**.
- Basic unit: joule = watt<span>&#183;</span>second
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Power is the **rate** at which work is done, or energy is transmitted.
- Basic unit: watt = jourle/second

We need to know what we are talking about!

## Data quality

- Availability  
- Accessibility  
- Credibility  

Comparison, Validation, Verification

## Use data tools

- API  
- Packages   
- Open-souce tools

## Big data and AI era

- Big climate, earth, energy data available due to satellite, use-generated data, devices, sensors, smart meters
- Data driven approaches

Big data doesnot necessarily mean big picture   

AI doesnot necessarily mean better insights



## Project economics
 
- Simple payback  
- Discounting  
- Present/future value  
- Uniform payments (annuities)  
- Capital recovery factor  
- Comparing technologies/costs (LCOE)  
- Learning curve  
- Market and technology drivers 

## Sample analytic questions

- What's the LCOE of a new technology?  
- When to retire a nuclear/coal power plant?    
- Should I install rooftop solar or buy an EV?  
- How long should the government subsidies heatpump?  
- When can offshore wind achieve grid parity?  


## Time is money

- Money value changes in time: a dollar today worth more than a dollar tomorrow.    
- When money is invested, its amount changes with the return.  
- When money is transferred into assets, its value change due to depreciation and/or inflation.  
- Discounted cash flow is a technique that allow us to evaluate values as they change over time.  
  

## Payback period 

<center>
$Payback\ Period = Initial\ Investment ÷ Annual\ Cash\ Flow$
</center>

Simple payback: no discounting  
Payback: with discounting  


## Capital Recovery Factor (CRF)

Ratio of a constant annunity to the present value of receiving that annuity for a given length of time.

<center>
$CRF = \frac{i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n - 1}$
</center>


## Discounting

<center>
$discount\ rate (r) = interest\ rate (i) + inflation$
</center>

## The power of discounting

## Declining discounting

:::

## LCOE
<center>
$LCOE=\frac{\text{sum of costs over lifetime}}{\text{sum of electricity produced over life time}}=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}{\frac{I_t+M_t+F_t}{(1+r)^t}}}{\sum_{t=1}^{n}{E_t}}$
</center>

<p style="font-size:20pt; color:gray; text-align:center">
I: Investment costs  
M: Operation and maintaince costs  
F: Fuel costs 
</p>

## Comparing LCOE

::: footer
Source: [Lazard’s 2024 LCOE+ report](https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf)
:::

## Limitations of LCOE

- Fossil: Do not include other costs (e.g. enviromental, carbon, etc.)   
- RE: Do not include integraton costs
- Focus on economics, do not include social cultural acceptance


## Learning curve

:::columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](/images/cumulative-learning-curve.png){fig-align="center"}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Empircial relations between unit costs and cumulative production.
<center>
$Y = aX^b$

$Pr=2^{b}$

$Lr=1-Pr=1-2^{b}$
</center>

<p style="font-size:20pt; color:gray; text-align:center">
Y: Unit costs  
a: Cost of first unit  
X: Units  
b: Slope of the learning curve  
Pr: Progress ratio   
Lr: Learing rate
</p>

## Source of learning

Learning by doing

- Economy of scale  
- Economy of scope  

Learning by researching

## Summary

- Project economics is useful for basic cost-benefit analysis  
- Getting the price (discounting) right  
- Understanding technology dynamics will help to model future projections  
- Aware of the limitations

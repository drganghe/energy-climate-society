## An analytical approach

Data-driven, evidence-based, energy and climate policy

Using analytic tool to answer questions such as:

-   What will be the climate future if we do nothing?
-   What technology to invest to achieve our climate goal?
-   What will be the impact to carbon emission of IRA?
-   How NYS/NYC could achieve its climate goals?

## Two quotes about models

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
George Box:

>All models are wrong, but some are useful.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Albert Einstein:

>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
:::
:::


## Models can be useful

-   Prediction/Projection
-   Simulation
-   Optimization
-   Control
-   Stochastic/dynamic
-   Policy: Scenarios

Models help us think

## Modeling is hard

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![]({{< var file_path >}}/images/EIA-coal-consumption-forecasts.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![]({{< var file_path >}}/images/WEO-PV-projections.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Why?

-   **Risk**: System structural change could break our core data and assumptions that are based on historical experience. Example: shale gas revolution.

-   **Uncertainty**: The exact timing and character of pivotal events and technology changes is unpredictable. Example: renewables cost changes, fussion.

## The Energy Trillemma: Balancing trade-offs

![]({{< var file_path >}}/images/world-energy-trilemma-2021.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: r-fit-text
**Energy security**: Ensure reliable energy supply

**Energy equity**: Provide universal access to reliable, affordable, and abundant energy

**Environmental Sustainability**: Avoid environmental harm or climate impact

Those goals sometimes conflict with each other, and decisions has to make trade-offs between them

## End with two quotes {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Bill Hogan:

> It is not the individual results of a model that are so important; it is the improved user appreciation of the policy problem that is the greatest contribution of modeling.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Huntington, Weyant, Sweeney "Modeling for insights, not numbers":

> The primary goal of policy modeling should be the insights quantitative models can provide, not the precise-looking projections --i.e. numbers -- they can produce for any given scenario.

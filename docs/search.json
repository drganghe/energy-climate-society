Let’s do some project ecoconomics calculation to see if it make sense to purchase an EV, vs, an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle. (3pt)\nA basic Chevrollet Bolt EV starting at $29,700, and an Honda Civic ICE starting at $23,950, according to official releases.\nAssume you drive 13,476 miles per year as average U.S. drivers do1. Electricity price: $0.2/kWh; Gasoline price: $3.5/gallon. Efficiency: EV: 28kWh/100mile; ICE: 30mile/gallon (mpg) Life-time: 10years Resale value after 10 years: EV: $5,000; ICE: $10,000 Discont rate: 4%\n\nCalculating the NPV of the EV and ICE, and decide which vehicle should you purchase based on economics?\n\nIRA offers $7,500 tax credit2 for EV purchase, will that change your decision?\n\nWhat if the discount rate is 8%, will that change your decision?\n\nCalculating the carbon mitigation by driving an EV at New York State during the 10 years? New York State grid carbon intensity is on average 0.55 short tons CO2 per MWh3 of electricity generated. And the carbon intesity of finished gasoline is 8.10kgCO2/gallon4.\nWhat’s the cost of conserved CO2 in this case? (Hint: NPV difference/total carbon mitigation)"

You may able to find those statistics on the web, however, I hope you can use plant level data to calculate those by yourself.\nThere are a few places that you may find plant level data. We will use EPA eGRID which includes emissions, emission rates, generation, heat input, resource mix, and many other attributes. Please download eGRID with 2021 data in metric units."

    "text": "We discussed Defining a Rosenfeld Plant in Lecture 9. That paper was published in 2010, now more than a decade has past and let’s update the Rosenfeld Plant to 2021.\nTo define a Rosenfeld Plant, you would need to figure out the average size of U.S. coal plants, the average capacity factor of those operating plants, average emission factor of coal power plants. You may able to find those statistics on the web, however, I hope you can use plant level data to calculate those by yourself.\nThere are a few places that you may find plant level data. We will use EPA eGRID which includes emissions, emission rates, generation, heat input, resource mix, and many other attributes. Please download eGRID with 2021 data in metric units."

(0.5pt)[Hint: the “PLNT21” tab shows plant level data, and you can filter data by plant primary fuel to get all COAL plants]\n\nWhat’s the average capacity factor of coal plants in 2021? (0.5 pt) [Hint: use total generation and total capacity to calculate the average capacity factor]\n\nWhat’s the average carbon emission factor of coal plants in 2021? (0.5pt) [Hint: use total carbon emission and total generation to calculate the average emission factor]\n\nUsing the updated parameters, what’s the total annual carbon emissions of an updated Rosenfeld Plant? (1 pt)\n\nWhat’s the average efficiency of coal plants in 2021? (0.5pt) [Hint: use total plant annual net generation and total plant annual heat input to calculate the average efficiency]\n\nComparing the average efficiency of combined heat and power plants and those with power only, how much differences the efficiency data shows? (1 pt)[Hint: use total plant annual net generation and total plant annual heat input to calculate the average efficiency]\n\nIf we can improve the average efficiency of coal plants by 1% (percentage point), e.g. 32% to 33%, how many new Rosenfeld Plant we can avoid building? [Hint: use the same total coal generation] (1pt)\n\nFurther explore the data, what are the top 10 carbon emitting plants in the U.S. and think about how to reduce carbon emissions for those plants (1 pt)\n\nNote: please show your process to receive partial credit.\nPlug: eGRID has rich resources and we will come back to this assignment when discuss environmental and climate justice."

This course offers a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the science behind climate change, the complex technological and policy considerations, and the necessary pathways to transition towards a carbon-neutral future. Over the course of the semester, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of climate science and explore the latest research on climate change. We will also examine the various energy technologies available and the challenges of transitioning towards a sustainable energy system. In addition, we will explore the policy and economic considerations that underpin energy and climate policy, and the social and cultural dimensions of this complex issue. Ultimately, the goal of this class is to provide students with a broad understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the energy and climate crisis.

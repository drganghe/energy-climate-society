Step 2: Model future climate responses, such as temperature increase and sea level rise (CO2 concentrations). Step 3: Assess the economic impact that these climatic changes will have on agriculture, health, energy use, and other aspects of the economy (Damage function). Step 4: Convert future damages into their present-day value and add them up to determine total damages (Discounting).\n\n\n\n\nAn integrated, modular framework for estimating the social cost of carbon (SC-CO2)1"

(1 pt)\n\nWhat’s the average efficiency of coal plants in 2021? (0.5pt) [Hint: use total plant annual net generation and total plant annual heat input to calculate the average efficiency]\n\nComparing the average efficiency of combined heat and power plants and those with power only, how much differences the efficiency data shows? (1 pt)[Hint: use total plant annual net generation and total plant annual heat input to calculate the average efficiency]\n\nIf we can improve the average efficiency of coal plants by 1% (percentage point), e.g. 32% to 33%, how many new Rosenfeld Plant we can avoid building? [Hint: use the same total coal generation] (1pt)\n\nFurther explore the data, what are the top 10 carbon emitting plants in the U.S. and think about how to reduce carbon emissions for those plants (1 pt)\n\nNote: please show your process to receive partial credit.\nPlug: eGRID has rich resources and we will come back to this assignment when discuss environmental and climate justice."

This course offers a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the science behind climate change, the complex technological and policy considerations, and the necessary pathways to transition towards a carbon-neutral future. Over the course of the semester, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of climate science and explore the latest research on climate change. We will also examine the various energy technologies available and the challenges of transitioning towards a sustainable energy system. In addition, we will explore the policy and economic considerations that underpin energy and climate policy, and the social and cultural dimensions of this complex issue. Ultimately, the goal of this class is to provide students with a broad understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the energy and climate crisis. We hope to inspire and equip students to pursue careers in the energy and climate field, and to empower them with the knowledge and skills needed to make a positive impact on climate solutions."

    "text": "Background\nOn August 16, President Biden Signed H.R. 5376, The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The law targets to reduce U.S. carbon emission by 40% compared to the 2005 level, but can it deliver? Energy systems analysis could help to answer such questions. Three notable groups have released energy and emissions models that have been widely cited by lawmakers, advocates and the press:\n\nThe REPEAT Project, an academic initiative that aims for data-driven climate policy at Princeton University, estimated the bill would cut emissions 42 percent of 2005 levels by 2030, or 27 percent without it.\nThe Rhodium Group, an economic and environment consulting firm, found that emissions would fall 31 to 44 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the “Inflation Reduction Act”, and decline 24 to 35 percent without the bill.\nEnergy Innovation, a climate and energy think tank, showed that emissions would fall 37 to 41 percent of 2005 levels by the end of the decade with the bill, compared to 24 percent without it."

Over the course of the semester, we will cover a broad range of topics, including an overview of the energy and climate landscape, project economics, energy sources and technologies, energy demand, environmental and health impacts, power system analysis, energy transition strategies, energy efficiency, sustainable consumption, climate justice, big data and AI for climate change, and the limitations of models. We will also explore emerging topics relevant to energy systems and achieving carbon neutrality. Through a combination of lectures, case studies, and real-world assignments, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the essentials of energy and climate policy. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to pursue a career in the energy and climate policy field.

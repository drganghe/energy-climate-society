## Energy, environmental, climate justice

| Energy | Environmental | Climate |
|---|---|---|
| Energy supply/demand | Environment burden/benefits | Climate impact/benefits |

**Common Questions**:  
Who bears the burden? Who harvests the benefits? Do we know the injustice? Can people involve in the decision proceses? How to compensate?

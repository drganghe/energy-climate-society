## Sample analytic questions

-   How to compare the emissions of energy technology fairly?\
-   Does EV reduces or increase emissions?\
-   Does CO2 enhanced oil recovery reduces carbon emission?\
-   GHG implications of biomass?\

## LCA questions

- Paper or plastic grocery bags  
- Cloth or disposable diapers  
- Digital or hardcopy papers/books  
- Plastic water bottles or tap water  

## System thinking

- Acknowledging the complex connectivity of our societies, economies and the natural environment  
- Understanding system behaviors and responses (positive and negative)  
- Modifying complex systems to achieve a more sustainable balance  
- Life cycle thinking, applied to products and processes, is a specific example of systems thinking

## Another thought experiment

How should drinks be provided?  
- 12 oz. aluminum (soda) cans   
- 12 oz. steel (soda) cans   
- 2 liter plastic (soda) bottles  
- 8 oz. (fresh juice) boxes  
- 32 oz. paperboard (fresh juice) boxes  
- 8 oz. paperboard  (concentrated and frozen juice) cans  
- 10 oz. refillable glass bottles (from the 1970s)  
- Syrup concentrate (from fountain machines)

## History of LCA

Initial LCA work was focused on energy  

1969 - first multi-criteria study for Coca-Cola   
- Glass versus plastic for container   
- Choice between internal / external container production  
- End of life options (recycling or one-way)   
- Result: plastic bottle was better, contrary to expectations   
- Study never published   
- Questions of validity then occurred  
- Led to calls by scientific community for a standardization process

## The 80’s: LCA as a marketing instrument

LCA was used in the marketing claims

In 1991, the USA denounced the use of LCA results until further standards were in place.

## 1997: ISO 14000 Standardization{.smaller}

| ISO 14000         | Standards of Environmental Management                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ISO 14001         | Certification of Environmental Management Systems        |
| ISO 14010         | Audit guidelines                                         |
| ISO 14011         | Audit methodology                                        |
| ISO 14012         | Qualification of auditors                                |

## Rationale for a standard{.smaller}

- Want things done consistently  
  - Common guidelines 
- Want to set level playing field in a market 
  - Following the standard is assessable, and determined compliant 
- Analogous to ASTM and other “test standards” 
  - e.g., consistent concrete is desired and can be specified in a construction bid request: “we want ASTM C94 concrete” 
  - LEED Green Building Standards family 
- Standards generally voluntary, but may be required by contract (require ISO 9000 compliant firm)

## Standard oganization

- Scope
- Normative references
- Terms and definitions
- General description of LCA
  - Principles; Phases; Key features; General concepts of product systems
- Methodological framework 
- Reporting 
- Critical review

## What LCA is what's not

- LCA is a way of structuring/organizing the relevant parts of the life cycle
- It is a tool to track performance
- LCA is not a cure-all for our environmental problems
- LCA is not an “exact” science with provable axioms/theories
- LCA is part of the sustainability tool box

## Uncertainties in LCA{.smaller}

- Use care in using simplistic methods to support decisions  
- “A decision made without taking uncertainty into account is barely worth calling a decision.”  (Wilson, 1985)  
- Presumed focus of book and course   
- We’re doing LCA for big decisions  
  - Hybrid cars? Green energy? Change-the-world policy questions  
- Thus analysis should be as good as possible  
- “It depends” studies perhaps just not “complete” studies  
- LCA is a robust methodology that requires careful choice of methods and leverage of quantitative tools.

## Summary

-   System thinking and LCA thinking\
-   LCA could offer insights\
-   Learning those new tools and skills to do basic LCA\
-   LCA is a system think to address energy and climate challenges.

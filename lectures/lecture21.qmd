## Sample analytic questions

-   How do I know if I should trust your results?\
-   What are the methods to address uncertainties?\
-   What are the emerging topics to improve modeling analysis?\
-   How to interpret modeling results to communicate effectively?\
-   Where to use model? How to build your analysis?

## Conditions for model robustness

Models can be accurate when they describe systems that  

- are observable and measurable  
- exhibit constancy of structure over time  
- exhibit constancy across variations in conditions not specified in the model  
- permit the collection of ample data

## Social economic structural changes

- Core data and assumptions, which drive results, are based on historical experiences, which can be off if structural conditions change  
- The exact timing and character of pivotal events and technology changes is unpredictable

## Mission impossible

- Predict the unpredictable  
- Price the priceless  


## Better modeling uncertainties {.smaller}

- Define an endpoint of analysis  
- List all uncertain parameters  
- Specify maximum range of values  
- Specify subjective probability distribution for values within the range  
- Determin and account for correlations  
- Probability distribution of model predictions  
- Derive quantitative uncertainties 
- Obtain additional data and repeat analysis if needed

Examples 

- Risk averse investors  
- Subsidies or taxes  
- Carbon lock-in  
- Unequal costs and benefits of climate polices accrue to different groups  
- Public opinion  
- Confidence in political institutions  
- Trade and investments  
- Competence of goverment

## Why a model in the first place{.smaller}

- Description  
- Explanation  
- Experimentation  
- Providing sources of analogy  
- Communication/Education  
- Providing focal objects or centerpiece for scientific dialogue  
- Thought experiment  
- Projection  


## Modeling for insights

- Modeling based on research questions  
- Modeling elements, structure, relations  
- Do not over-interpret  
- Do not misinterpret  
- "All models are wrong, but some are **useful**". Avoid useless models.  


## Focusing on structures and relations

## Knowing limitations

- Known unknowns  
- Unknown unknowns  
- "Garbage in, garbage out"  


## Interpreting results

- Results are outcomes of assumptions and models  
- Results does not automatically translate to policies  
- Communicating the limitations and uncertainties  


## Open source 

- Open model (code)  
- Open data  
- Open results  
- Open validation  

In Open we Trust!

## Ensure model for society

- Mind the assumptions  
- Mind the hubris  
- Mind the framing  
- Mind the consequences  
- Mind the unknowns  
- Questions not answers

## Summary

-   Know the limitation of models\
-   Use model appropriately\
-   Interpret/communicate the results effectively\
-   Models for social good

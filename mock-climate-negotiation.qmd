## Objective

Students will simulate international climate negotiations to understand:

- Complexities of policymaking  
- Explore the dynamics of global cooperation  
- Gain practical skills and insights into the roles of different stakeholders in addressing climate change  

## Session Structure

### Preparation Phase (Pre-Negotiation)

Duration: 1-2 months prior to the simulation

- Topic Assignment: Assign each student or group to represent a specific country or stakeholder group (e.g., industrialized nations, developing nations, small island states, NGOs, or business representatives).  

- Background Research: Students will research their assigned country’s or group’s:  

  - Greenhouse gas emissions profile^[[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org)]  
  - Economic priorities and vulnerabilities^[[World Economic Outlook](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO)]  
  - Climate commitments under the Paris Agreement^[[NDCs](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/indcs)]  
  - Political and social challenges   
  - Negotiation History 

- Deliverables:

  - A one-page position paper summarizing their negotiation stance.  
  - A brief 2-3 minute opening statement outlining their priorities.

### Simulation Day

Duration: 2-3 hours

Step 1: Opening Statements (10-15 minutes)

Each delegation presents their country’s or group’s position, highlighting key goals and red lines.

Step 2: Negotiation Rounds (1-1.5 hours)

- Round 1: Regional and Bloc Discussions (30 minutes)  

Countries form groups based on alliances or shared interests (e.g., EU, G77, Umbrella Group). Each bloc formulates a unified stance on key negotiation topics such as mitigation targets, financing, and adaptation measures.

- Round 2: Plenary Negotiations (30 minutes)

Delegations present their bloc’s positions and negotiate with other blocs to find areas of compromise. Use a moderator (instructor or student volunteer) to guide the discussion and ensure adherence to time limits (3 minutes maximum for each presentation).

Step 3: Final Agreement (30 minutes)

Delegations draft and vote on a final agreement. Achieving consensus is ideal but not mandatory; differing levels of agreement can reflect real-world outcomes.

### Debrief and Reflection Phase (Post-Negotiation)

Duration: 30-45 minutes

- Class Discussion:

  - What were the main challenges in reaching an agreement?  
  - How did power dynamics and disparities influence the negotiations?  
  - What lessons can be applied to real-world climate policymaking?  

- Individual Reflection: 

Students write a short essay (1-2 pages) discussing their experiences, including what they learned about their assigned role and the overall negotiation process.

## Topics and Organization

**Key Topics for Negotiation**

1. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs): Ambition levels and timeline commitments.  
2. Climate Finance: Funding mechanisms to support developing nations in mitigation and adaptation.  
3. Loss and Damage: Compensation for climate-related damages in vulnerable nations.  
4. Technological Transfers: Strategies for sharing clean energy technologies.  
5. Global Stocktake: Review and accountability mechanisms.  
6. Adaptation: Strategies for responding to climate change.

**Logistics and Organization**

- Materials:
  - Printed negotiation rules and position guidelines.
  - Nameplates for country/stakeholder delegations.
  - Access to a whiteboard or digital tool for drafting agreements.

- Room Setup: Arrange desks in a U-shaped configuration to encourage discussion and create a formal negotiation atmosphere. Online Zoom virtual negotiation room background.

- Role of Instructor:

  - Act as the Chair to facilitate the simulation and keep time.  
  - Intervene only when necessary to ensure productive dialogue.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will learn:

1. Understand the complexity of international climate negotiations and the importance of consensus-building.
2. Develop skills in public speaking, negotiation, and teamwork.
3. Gain empathy for the diverse perspectives and constraints of global stakeholders.

Social cost of carbon (SCC) is a very important concept in energy and climate policy. It quantifies the economic damages from one extra ton of carbon dioxide. 

Read more about social cost of carbon here: [Social Cost of Carbon 101](https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/social-cost-carbon-101/)


## How SCC are calculated

>Estimates of the SCC are calculated in four steps using Integraed Assessment Models (IAMs).
>
>Step 1: Predict future emissions based on population, economic growth, and other factors (CO2 emissions).
>Step 2: Model future climate responses, such as temperature increase and sea level rise (CO2 concentrations).
>Step 3: Assess the economic impact that these climatic changes will have on agriculture, health, energy use, and other aspects of the economy (Damage function).
>Step 4: Convert future damages into their present-day value and add them up to determine total damages (Discounting).

## [Social Cost of Carbon Explorer](https://www.rff.org/publications/data-tools/scc-explorer/)

There are quite some models and tools are available. We will use the open-source RFF-Berkeley Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model as an example to play with SCC, key assumption, and how those parameters would impact the value of SCC.

Key factors:

- CO2 emissions 
- CO2 concentrations 
- Damage function 
- Discounting 


## Other models

- Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model [RISE/DICE 2023](https://yale.app.box.com/s/whlqcr7gtzdm4nxnrfhvap2hlzebuvvm)

- EPA (\$51/ton $\rightarrow$ \$190/ton)

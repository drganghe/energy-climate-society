## NREL SAM model

"The System Advisor Model (SAM) is a free techno-economic software model
that facilitates decision-making for people in the renewable energy
industry."[^1]

[^1]: NREL, https://sam.nrel.gov/

Read the model description and instruction:
<https://samrepo.nrelcloud.org/help/index.html>

Download and install the current version. It's free, however, you need
register to receive a key by email to use the software.

## Technologies

The current version of SAM includes performance models for the following
technologies:

-    PV

-   Battery storage

-   Wind

-   Concentrating Solar Power (CSP)
